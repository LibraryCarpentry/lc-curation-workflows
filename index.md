This Library Carpentry lesson is the second in a series of lessons included in the Curating for Reproducibility Curriculum. [Lesson 1: Introduction to Curating for Reproducibility](https://curating4reproducibility.org/cure-carpentry-01-intro/) established definitions of reproducibility, specified the standards by which reproducibility can be assessed, and described the role of the library and information science professional in supporting reproducibility.

This lesson operationalizes the concepts and standards around reproducibility by further exploring dimensions of data quality and translating them into discrete curation activities.  These activities are described as part of the Data Quality Review (DQR) framework, which extends the typical data curation workflow to incorporate code review actions necessary for ensuring reproducibility.  

The goal of this lesson is to give learners a deeper understanding of the relationship between reproducibility, quality standards, and curation, and to offer a adoptable framework for curation workflows that support reproducibility.  This lesson is also designed to prepare learners for [Lesson 3: Reproducibility Assessment](curating4reproducibility.org/cure-carpentry-03-assessing/), which offers an exciting opportunity for learners to apply their knowledge of reproducibility standards and the DQR framework to hands-on practice performing reproducibility assessment activities.
